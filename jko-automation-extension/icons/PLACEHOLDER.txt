To complete the installation, you need to add three icon files to this directory:

Required files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

How to create them:
1. Open ../icons/create-icons.html in a browser and download the icons
2. OR run: python3 ../generate_icons.py
3. OR use any PNG images of the correct sizes and rename them

Once you have the icons, delete this PLACEHOLDER.txt file.
